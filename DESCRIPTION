Title: Mixture Model Temporal Errors In RSVP Data
Description: Model the data from RSVP paradigms (such as asking people to report a circled letter from an a longer, successively-presented rapid series of letters) that yield temporal errors. A temporal error is when one reports not the cued (circled) letter but rather a letter presented at a different time, often a nearby time, with error -1 meaning the letter before the cued one was reported. Model the distribution of temporal errors using a mixture of a Gaussian distribution and the guessing distribution, and return their proportions and the mean (latency) and standard deviation (precision) of the Gaussian.
