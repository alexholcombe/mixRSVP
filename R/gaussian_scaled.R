#Calculate the underlying continuous Gaussian, not discretized. But how high should it be?

#Given a dataset of 100 points. Take the Gaussian density, area under the curve is 1,
#and make the area under the curve = 100?
#But wait a second - the curve goes forever, but I'm only showing -17 to 17.
#No, but each of those 100 points is actually a grainsize portion of the curve.
#So, calculate the area of the Gaussian density for each bin. Then multiply by a normalizing
#factor so that the total area of all the bins equals the number of datapoints.
#This is neglecting that we're talking about a truncated Gaussian, and
#  possiby tapered by frequency of possible SPEs

areaOfGaussianBin<- function(binStart,binWidth,latency,precision) {
  #Calculate area under the unit curve for that bin
  area <- pnorm(binStart+binWidth,latency,precision) - pnorm(binStart,latency,precision)
  return (area)
}

gaussian_scaled<- function(efficacy,latency,precision,numObservations,minSPE,maxSPE,grain) {
  #At each minSPE:grain:maxSPE value, calculate Gaussian at
  #  height appropriate for plotting with the histogram of the SPE data

  #Calculate area under the unit Gaussian curve for each bin

  #Calculate beginning x value of each bin, e.g. -0.5 for 0 if grain =1
  binStarts= seq(minSPE-grain/2, maxSPE-grain/2, grain)
  #Calculate area under the unit Gaussian for each bin. This corresponds
  #Send each SPE individually to the areaOfGaussianBin function with additional parameters
  binAreasGaussian<- sapply(binStarts, areaOfGaussianBin,   grain,latency,precision)

  #Now we have the probability of each bin, but they don't sum to 1 because it wasn't at truncated Gaussian
  #We can now accomplish truncation of the Gaussian by summing the area of all the bins and dividing
  #that into each bin, to normalize it so that the total of all the bins =1.
  probEachBin<- binAreasGaussian / sum(binAreasGaussian)
  #An alternative, arguably better way to do it would be to assume that anything in the Gaussian tails
  # beyond the  bins on either end ends up in those end bins.

  #Now there's the matter of the actual dataset.
  #The area under the histogram does not sum to 1, it instead sums to the number of trials.
  #So we need to achieve the same thing for our theoretical Gaussian curve, except that
  #our Gaussian curve is responsibe for only efficacy proportion of the trials.

  #numObservations reflects grain of 1. But if using finer grain to plot, need to scale up
  numTheoreticalObservations <- numObservations * 1/grain

  gaussianThis<- probEachBin * numTheoreticalObservations * efficacy

  #Slide it into a dataframe with the bins indicated
  gaussianThis<-data.frame(x=seq(minSPE,maxSPE,grain), gaussianFreq=gaussianThis)

  #Note: not tapered

  return(gaussianThis)

#Each call to gaussianScaledForData returns a larger dataframe than was sent.
