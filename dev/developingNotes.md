# To-do

Would be ridiculous to use ggplot2:: everytime invoked that ,but is that the way to get rid of "plot_hist_with_fit: no visible binding for global variable ‘SPE’" ?

# Testing

test_file('mixtureModeling/tests/test_fitModel.R')
test_dir('mixtureModeling/tests/') # test all files in directory
